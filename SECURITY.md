## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of EchoLoc-NN seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:
- **Email**: security@echoloc-nn.org (preferred)
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Every week until resolution
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 30 days, others within 90 days

## Security Considerations

### Hardware Security
- Ultrasonic systems can be vulnerable to acoustic jamming attacks
- Ensure proper input validation for all sensor data
- Implement rate limiting to prevent sensor flooding
- Use encrypted communication channels when possible

### Data Privacy  
- Position data is sensitive personal information
- Implement data minimization principles
- Provide clear opt-out mechanisms for data collection
- Follow applicable privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

### Model Security
- Deep learning models can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks
- Implement input sanitization and anomaly detection
- Consider differential privacy for training data
- Validate model outputs against physical constraints

### Dependencies
- Regularly audit third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Use automated tools like `pip-audit` and `safety`
- Pin dependency versions in production deployments
- Monitor security advisories for PyTorch and other ML frameworks

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. Run security checks before committing: `make security-check`
2. Keep dependencies updated and audit regularly
3. Use virtual environments for isolation
4. Follow secure coding practices for C extensions
5. Validate all external inputs (sensor data, configuration files)

### For Users
1. Keep EchoLoc-NN updated to the latest version
2. Use HTTPS for all network communications
3. Implement proper access controls in production deployments
4. Monitor system logs for unusual activity
5. Regular security assessments of hardware deployments

### For Hardware Integrators
1. Secure physical access to ultrasonic arrays
2. Use authenticated communication protocols
3. Implement tamper detection mechanisms
4. Regular firmware updates for microcontrollers
5. Network segmentation for IoT deployments

## Known Security Considerations

### Acoustic Attacks
- **DoS via Acoustic Interference**: High-power ultrasonic signals can disrupt operation
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust noise filtering and signal validation

### Side-Channel Attacks  
- **Timing Attacks**: Processing time variations could leak position information
- **Mitigation**: Implement constant-time algorithms where possible

### Model Poisoning
- **Training Data Contamination**: Malicious training data could compromise model accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Validate training data sources and implement outlier detection

## Security Tools Integration

The project includes several security scanning tools:

```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
make security-check

# Secret detection
detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline

# Static analysis
bandit -r echoloc_nn/

# Container scanning (when using Docker)
docker scan echoloc-nn:latest
```

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will work with security researchers to:
- Confirm and prioritize reported vulnerabilities
- Develop and test fixes
- Coordinate disclosure timelines
- Provide credit to researchers (unless anonymity is preferred)

Thank you for helping keep EchoLoc-NN and our community safe!
